          p Welcome to my portfolio site! I love basketball, movie, and travelling :))!
          P I am a passionate learner with a strong interest in environmental protection. I am particularly passionate about using my skills and knowledge in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to help address environmental issues. As a GISer, I am enthusiastic about programming and building interactive web maps that can help visualize complex environmental data in new and innovative ways. I believe that by using technology to better understand and communicate environmental issues, we can work towards more sustainable and equitable solutions. I am excited about the potential of GIS and web mapping to contribute to a better future for our planet and am committed to learning and growing in these areas.
